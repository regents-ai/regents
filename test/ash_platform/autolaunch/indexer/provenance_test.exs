defmodule AshPlatform.Autolaunch.Indexer.ProvenanceTest do
  @moduledoc """
  Where a stored log is allowed to have come from, and what admits its address.

  The address filter is a request, not a guarantee, so every log the provider
  returns is checked against the admitted set, against the height the fetched
  headers place it at, and against the block its address became interesting at.
  The heads the range is drawn between are checked against each other the same
  way, and admitting a source states one fact that cannot be quietly restated
  as another.
