defmodule AshPlatform.Autolaunch.Indexer.FinalityTest do
  @moduledoc """
  What the provider's exact finalized hash is, and is not, enough to promote.

  Protects CONNECTED_FINALITY_ONLY. The finalized hash names one stored block;
  everything promoted with it has to be reachable from that block through stored
  parent hashes. A canonical segment sitting at an obviously promotable height
  with no stored link to the finalized evidence is not final and is left alone,
  however long it waits, and it becomes final the moment the missing header is
  stored. Growth is bounded at both ends, so a deep backfill is caught up over
  ordinary later passes rather than in one unbounded promotion.
