  @moduledoc """
  What re-reading a range the ledger already holds is allowed to do.

  Exact evidence replays as a no-op, disagreeing evidence under the same identity
  fails the whole transaction closed, and neither a finalized header nor an
  orphaned one is ever rewritten by a later pass. A fork the ledger has already
  abandoned is never revived: a provider that oscillates between two views — one
  load-balanced node behind another during a reorg — stops the pass rather than
  advancing the cursor over headers no consumer can see.
