  @moduledoc """
  That one granted lease outlives the pass it was granted for.

  Nothing renews a lease mid-pass, so the only thing that keeps a slow provider
  from making every commit uncommittable is arithmetic: the bound caps how many
  requests a pass can issue, the transport caps how long one request can take,
  and the lease is derived from their product rather than picked. The counts are
  proven by the requests the fake endpoint was actually handed, so no test waits
  on a clock.
