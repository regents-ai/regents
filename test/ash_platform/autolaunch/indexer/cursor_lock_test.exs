defmodule AshPlatform.Autolaunch.Indexer.CursorLockTest do
  @moduledoc """
  What the shared cursor row lock guarantees, proven on real second connections.

  PostgreSQL reports the ordering through `pg_blocking_pids`, so nothing here
  waits on a clock: a source admission and a range commit contend for one lock,
  and a lease admits exactly one writer while still letting the next pass start
  as soon as the last one lets go.

  Protects SOURCE_SET_CHANGE_INVALIDATES_STALE_WORK in both orderings. A range
  planned before an address was watched must never commit over the heights that
  address emits from, so a genuinely new source clears the lease whatever its
  start block; and when the commit reaches the lock first, the admission behind
  it pulls the cursor back exactly as far as the new address needs and no
  further. Re-stating a source the ledger already watches is the same fact twice
  and is allowed to disturb nothing at all.
