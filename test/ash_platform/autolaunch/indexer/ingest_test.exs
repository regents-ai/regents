  @moduledoc """
  What one bounded pass will and will not accept from the provider.

  A first range bootstraps where nothing is stored to link to, a source admitted
  behind the cursor backfills the addresses it opened, and missing, broken,
  stray or wrong-chain evidence advances nothing at all. A range that overlaps
  stored headers is compared height by height, a divergence rewinds only what is
  still revisable, and a provider failure during the backward walk is a failure
  rather than evidence of a fork.
