defmodule AshPlatform.Autolaunch.LaunchOperation do
  @moduledoc """
  One durable direct-wallet launch the server owns before any wallet opens.

  The reviewed sequence is immutable and lives in `envelope`: at most an exact
  REGENT allowance correction followed by the one `launch` call it enables.
  `step` says which of those two transactions is wallet-capable right now and
  `state` says how far that one transaction has got, so exactly one step is
  sendable at a time and its hash is bound before the next becomes so.

  The database decides every race. `action_id` is unique, each hash column is
  unique within itself across every operation, and a partial identity over
  `terminal_at IS NULL` allows one open launch per human account. A claimed step
  whose outcome is unknown holds that slot until the account explicitly ends it;
  it never becomes a fresh send, and a hash that arrives late attaches to the
  operation it belongs to without reopening it.

  `chain_verified` is the honest terminal success: this server proved its own
  receipt evidence. Canonical public launch confirmation is the finalized
  `490.8.2` projection and is deliberately not named here.
