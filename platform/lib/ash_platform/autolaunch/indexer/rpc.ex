defmodule AshPlatform.Autolaunch.Indexer.Rpc do
  @moduledoc """
  The indexer's own JSON-RPC transport, and the redaction boundary around it.

  The endpoint is dedicated to this indexer and separate from the simple-read
  RPC. It never reaches a result, an error, a row or a log line: a failure is
  reported as the method plus a small error class, so a URL carrying a provider
  key cannot escape through a crash report or a captured log.

  A reply counts only as this exchange's own answer: JSON-RPC 2.0, the id that
  was sent, and a result member. Nothing is retried and no redirect is followed,
  so one exchange is one HTTP attempt against the endpoint that was configured.

  The wall-clock ceiling on that attempt is owned here rather than by any
  timeout inside the transport, because a stage timeout bounds a stage and not
  the exchange: an attempt still running at the deadline is killed, and the
  handler's lease is derived from this enforced number.
