defmodule AshPlatform.Autolaunch.RpcClient do
  @moduledoc """
  The production Base client for bidding, which prepares nothing yet.

  `submitBid` takes `prevTickPriceQ96`, and the only sources for it today are an
  unbounded walk from the floor price or the floor itself. Neither is a reviewed
  answer, so `snapshot/1` refuses before it opens a connection; `regent-alv1.6`
  and `490.8.2/.3` own the bounded source that replaces this refusal.

  `verify/3` is complete, because a hash may still have to be told the truth
  about. It reads only canonical state: a receipt above the safe head, or one in
  a block that is no longer canonical, stays pending rather than becoming an
  answer, and an approval advances only once its own allowance really holds.
