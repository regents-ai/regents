  The one Base boundary a direct-wallet launch has.

  `snapshot/1` answers the whole reviewed question at one canonical safe block:
  the admitted factory's identity, its current fee and pause state, the active
  wallet's REGENT balance and its allowance to that factory, the reciprocal
  factory/strategy binding, the strategy's bound fee hook, and the strategy's
  founder-frozen launch terms. There is no partial answer: a review is derived
  from one snapshot or from none.

  `verify/3` is read-only. The browser reports a hash and stops; whether that
  hash confirmed, reverted or contradicted its own review is decided here.
