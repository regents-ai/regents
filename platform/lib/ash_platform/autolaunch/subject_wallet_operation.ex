defmodule AshPlatform.Autolaunch.SubjectWalletOperation do
  @moduledoc """
  One durable subject wallet operation the server owns before any wallet opens.

  The reviewed sequence is immutable and lives in `envelope`: at most an exact
  token approval followed by the one C1 call it enables. `step` says which of
  those two transactions is wallet-capable right now and `state` says how far
  that one transaction has got, so exactly one step is sendable at a time and its
  hash is bound before the next becomes so.

  The database decides every race. `action_id` is unique, each hash column is
  unique within itself across every operation, and a partial identity over
  `terminal_at IS NULL` allows one open operation per human account and subject
  — a different subject stays completely independent. A claimed step whose
  outcome is unknown holds that slot until the account explicitly ends it; it
  never becomes a fresh send, and a hash that arrives late attaches to the
  operation it belongs to without reopening it.

  The same hash cannot settle in the other phase either: verification matches the
  exact target and calldata that phase reviewed, so an approval hash offered as
  an action hash fails identity rather than confirming.
