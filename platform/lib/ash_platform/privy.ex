  Exchanges a Privy token pair for the signed identity evidence it proves.

  The access token authenticates the subject and session and the identity
  token carries the signed linked accounts. Each is verified independently
  against the same public key, so ordinary signed-token expiry is the whole
  freshness authority and no evidence is accepted for a subject the access
  token did not itself authenticate. Only the access token must name a
  session: Privy's identity token carries no `sid` claim of its own, and one
  it does carry anyway must name the authenticated session.

  A refusal names the boundary that refused it as `{stage, reason}`, drawn only
  from a fixed vocabulary: `:missing_privy_config` for `:configuration`, one of
  the verifier's documented reasons plus `:unknown_verification_failure` for
  `:access_verification` and `:identity_verification` with
  `:missing_session_id` for `:access_verification` alone, and
  `:subject_mismatch`, `:session_mismatch`, `:access_role_confused` or
  `:identity_accounts_missing` for `:pair_binding`.
