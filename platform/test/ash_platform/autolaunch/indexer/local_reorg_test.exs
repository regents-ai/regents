defmodule AshPlatform.Autolaunch.Indexer.LocalReorgTest do
  @moduledoc """
  Which stored rows a reorg is allowed to retire, and when it refuses outright.

  Protects LOCAL_REORG_ONLY. A rewind judges one thing: the run of canonical
  rows that starts at the height just above the chosen ancestor and climbs by
  stored parent links. What sits above a gap in that run is not part of this
  reorg and is left exactly as it was, including its finality — an unrelated
  finalized segment higher up neither blocks the local decision nor is touched
  by it. A run longer than the bound is refused whole rather than half-applied,
  and refusing writes nothing at all.
