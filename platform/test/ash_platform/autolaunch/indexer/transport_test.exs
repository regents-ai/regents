defmodule AshPlatform.Autolaunch.Indexer.TransportTest do
  @moduledoc """
  What one JSON-RPC exchange is allowed to cost, and where it is allowed to go.

  Protects TRUE_TOTAL_RPC_DEADLINE. A blocked transport proves the deadline is
  the application's own and enforced rather than a transport stage's estimate:
  the exchange is abandoned, the work behind it is killed, the failure is
  reported without the key-bearing endpoint, and the chain is handed back inside
  the lease that was derived from that same ceiling. A real local HTTP answer on
  a real socket proves the two things no scripted transport can: that a redirect
  is refused instead of followed, and that a server error is still answered
  exactly once.
