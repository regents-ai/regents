defmodule AshPlatform.Autolaunch.LaunchRpcClient do
  @moduledoc """
  The production Base client for direct-wallet launches, which prepares nothing yet.

  A review needs the deployed factory address, and that address plus its runtime
  admission is deployment evidence nobody has frozen. Until then no address this
  lane could read is admitted evidence, so `snapshot/1` refuses before it opens a
  connection rather than reviewing against a value nobody has reviewed. That
  refusal is also what keeps a future admission honest: a snapshot has to answer
  the factory, the strategy and the strategy's bound fee hook at one exact
  reviewed block, so a provider that cannot serve every one of those reads at a
  block hash stays unavailable rather than reviewing against a different
  history.

  `verify/3` is complete, because a hash may still have to be told the truth
  about. It reads only canonical state: a receipt above the safe head, or one in
  a block that is no longer canonical, stays pending rather than becoming an
  answer, and every factory read a launch is confirmed by is executed against the
  exact block its own event was mined in.
