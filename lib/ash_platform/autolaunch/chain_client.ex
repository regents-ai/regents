  The one Base boundary a bid has: one snapshot before review, one read after each hash.

  `snapshot/1` answers the whole reviewed question at once — the auction's own
  currency, the wallet's REGENT, both allowances that stand between it and the
  auction, and the bounded predecessor tick the canonical call needs. There is no
  partial answer: a review is derived from one snapshot or from none.

  `verify/3` is read-only. The browser reports a hash and stops; whether that hash
  confirmed, reverted or contradicted its own review is decided here.
