defmodule AshPlatform.Autolaunch.SubjectWalletRpcClient do
  @moduledoc """
  The production Base client for subject wallet actions, which prepares nothing yet.

  A review needs the launch's real splitter and canonical receiver, and both are
  C5 address and runtime evidence that `490.8.2/.3` projection has still to make
  canonical. Until then no address this lane could read is admitted evidence, so
  `snapshot/1` refuses before it opens a connection rather than reviewing against
  a value nobody has frozen.

  `verify/3` is complete, because a hash may still have to be told the truth
  about. It reads only canonical state: a receipt above the safe head, or one in
  a block that is no longer canonical, stays pending rather than becoming an
  answer, and an approval advances only once its own allowance really holds.
