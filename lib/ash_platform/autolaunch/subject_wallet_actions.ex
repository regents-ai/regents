defmodule AshPlatform.Autolaunch.SubjectWalletActions do
  @moduledoc """
  The one boundary between a subject's wallet and Base.

  Preparation reads Base once, proves the stored splitter and canonical receiver
  really are this launch's own, and writes the whole reviewed sequence as a
  single immutable envelope. Every durable write after that runs inside
  `SessionAuthority.transact_lease/3` as the outermost transaction, against the
  account that callback locked, so a claim, a bound hash or a settled outcome
  cannot outlive a concurrent logout.

  The wallet Privy has selected drives everything. Its address arrives as
  untrusted browser input and is proved against the account the mounted lease
  resolves to before any private fact is read; there is no fall back to a stored
  primary wallet or to the first linked one.

  Provider reads always happen before the lease transaction; only the row write
  happens inside it, and the row is taken `FOR UPDATE` first, so two sockets
  racing the same step serialize and exactly one of them wins.
