  Every durable transition the Base ledger makes, and the row lock that orders
  them.

  Source admission and every commit ensure the chain's cursor row and then take
  the same `FOR UPDATE` lock on it, so an admission that rewinds the cursor and
  a range planned from the old position can never interleave: whichever reaches
  the lock second sees the other's decision, and a commit whose lease or exact
  planned cursor no longer holds rolls the whole range back rather than skipping
  or overwriting one.

  Provider work never happens inside these transactions. Headers and logs are
  inserted, never updated: the unique identity decides a duplicate race and a
  replay that disagrees with stored evidence aborts the transaction instead of
  rewriting it.

  The first admission creates the cursor at the source's start block; a later

  the current lease, because a range planned before this address existed would
  otherwise commit past it and skip its logs. Re-stating an address the ledger
