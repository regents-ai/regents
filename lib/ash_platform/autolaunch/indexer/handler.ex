defmodule AshPlatform.Autolaunch.Indexer.Handler do
  @moduledoc """
  The one durable-work item that moves the Base ledger forward.

  `poll/2` is pure: it names the chain and nothing else, so every database and
  provider read happens in the runner's monitored handler process and a failure
  advances nothing rather than taking the runner, the repository or the
  application supervisor with it.

  One bounded contiguous range is planned from the exact cursor the lease was
  granted at and fetched outside the row lock, then committed only if that same
  lease and that same cursor are still true. The range's first header is fetched
  and linked before anything else, so a divergence costs one request instead of
  the whole bound. Finality promotion uses the same bound and runs on its own
  when the safe head has not moved, so evidence can finalize while ingest is
  idle.
