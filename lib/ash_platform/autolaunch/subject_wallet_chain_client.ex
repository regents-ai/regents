  The one Base boundary a subject wallet action has.

  `snapshot/1` answers the whole reviewed question at once — the splitter's own
  bindings and treasury, the receiver's bindings and canonical economics where a
  payment needs them, the active wallet's three balances and stake, its current
  claimables, and the allowance standing between it and the spender. There is no
  partial answer: a review is derived from one snapshot or from none.

  `verify/3` is read-only. The browser reports a hash and stops; whether that
  hash confirmed, reverted or contradicted its own review is decided here.
