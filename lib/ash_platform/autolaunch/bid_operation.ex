defmodule AshPlatform.Autolaunch.BidOperation do
  @moduledoc """
  One durable bid the server owns before any wallet opens.

  The reviewed sequence is immutable and lives in `envelope`. `step` says which
  of its transactions is wallet-capable right now and `state` says how far that
  one transaction has got, so exactly one step is sendable at a time and its hash
  is bound before the next becomes so.

  The database decides every race: `action_id` is unique, each hash column is
  unique within itself, and a partial identity over `terminal_at IS NULL`
  allows one open bid per account. A claimed step whose
  outcome is unknown holds that slot until the account explicitly ends it; it
  never becomes a fresh send, and a hash that arrives late attaches to the
  operation it belongs to without reopening it.
