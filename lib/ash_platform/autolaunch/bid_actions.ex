  The one boundary between a bidder and Base.

  Preparation reads Base once, proves the auction really raises the bound REGENT,
  and writes the whole reviewed sequence as a single immutable envelope. Every
  durable write after that runs inside `SessionAuthority.transact_lease/3` as the
  outermost transaction, against the account that callback locked, so a claim, a
  bound hash or a settled outcome cannot outlive a concurrent logout.

  Provider reads always happen before the lease transaction; only the row write
  happens inside it, and the row is taken `FOR UPDATE` first, so two sockets
  racing the same step serialize and exactly one of them wins.
