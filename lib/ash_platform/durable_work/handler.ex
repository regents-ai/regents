  The deliberately small callback boundary used by `AshPlatform.DurableWork.Runner`.

  A handler owns the meaning and persistence of its context and items. `poll/2`
  must return no more than the capacity supplied by the runner; `handle/2` owns
  everything that happens for a returned item. The runner treats the value from
  `handle/2` as opaque and does not own or interpret it.
