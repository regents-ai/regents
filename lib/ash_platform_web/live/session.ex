  What the render knew, signed into the static LiveView token.

  `Phoenix.LiveView.Static.sign_token/2` signs with `Phoenix.Token`, which is
  integrity-only and readable by anyone holding the markup, so this carries the
  lineage-stable topic rather than the lineage itself: a digest that names the
  browser session without being able to authenticate as it. The route travels
  with it because a connected mount cannot otherwise learn it — `connect_info`
  `:uri` is the transport's own `/live/websocket` address and `socket.host_uri`
  carries no path, so only `handle_params` sees the page route, and that is too
  late to refuse a mount.

  Phoenix LiveView 1.2.7 hands `mount/3` `Map.merge(handshake_session,
  static_token_session)`, so both keys are the render's own and can never stand
  in for the authority the socket connected with.
