  One compact card for everything a wallet can do on a subject.

  The wallet Privy has selected drives everything here. Its address arrives as
  untrusted browser input and is proved against the mounted lease before any
  private fact is read or any durable write happens, so a wallet this account
  does not hold shows no balances and can neither review nor send.

  The browser reports a hash and stops. Every outcome on screen comes from the
  server's own read of that exact hash, and a claimed step is never offered a
  second send.
