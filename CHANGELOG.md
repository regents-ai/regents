## 2026-09-18 — Regents production release contents

### Staking and shared metadata

- Move the circulating market-cap figure into the right-hand staking summary,
  directly below Circulating REGENT, labeled **CIRCULATING MCAP:**.
- Remove the old market-cap box beside Buy REGENT and View Chart. Preserve both
  links, the existing calculation, the unavailable-value dash, and matching loading rows.
- Render public discovery metadata through the shared `Regent.AgentMetadata`
  component, pinned to design-system revision
  `36eb9d18d1e59df019fae0944183f8d6827bd7fe`.

### Included from the existing main branch

- `97761e4`: Align shell/overview/staking browser checks and correct phone overflow
  after the design refresh.
- `b142e4f`: Align homepage browser checks with the dark-locked landing page.
- `1fc85ef`: Let the page grid own the Redeem collection layout.
- `e00d4dd`: Give the Autolaunch Create treasury form room on a phone.
- `8ad33b9`: Clean up only the private drafts saved by each browser verification.

### Retained from the deployed agent-readiness release

- Public Markdown negotiation and recoverable agent-facing errors.
- Documentation, About and Contact pages; discovery metadata and sitemap.
- Updated agent guidance, public API documentation and synchronized contract headers.

This release targets Regents only. It adds no database migrations, changes no
claim ownership or Privy mappings, and does not deploy the other product sites.
